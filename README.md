Planning to go through 
http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/OnLine/
CSCI 1730 - Introduction to Programming Languages

And since that course is based on Racket, I figured I 
should get a jumpstart on my first Scheme-ish language 
so I'm starting to work through the basic Racket tutorial from:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html
